        tagged as 'description' can be optionally specified. Artifact types can be
        either 'portToFieldMap', 'bpmn' or any.   If the artifact type is 'portToFieldMap',
        specify the orchestration step ID tagged as 'stepId'.   Otherwise, 'name'
        will be used as 'stepId'.  (See the documentation for more information regarding
